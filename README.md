# dotfiles
(Author: Ethan Link)

Here are the dotfiles I'm currently using. So far, I've only made some for Bash, Vim, and Tmux

*Vim (.vimrc):*
  Most of this I pulled from an old employer who had a standard .vimrc, that I enjoyed using during that time.
  
*Bash (.bashrc):* 
  Used to use a standard .bashrc I found online, but now I prefer to maintain my own settings as I come across
  new things that I like. Here's what I have so far!
  
*Tmux (.tmux.conf):* (ARCHIVED, not a huge TMUX fan)
  I found this online ( GitHub user: spicycode, here's the url I used https://gist.github.com/spicycode/1229612 ). I made some slight       modifications to it because it's a little dated.
