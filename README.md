# dotfiles
(Author: Ethan Link)

Here are the dotfiles I'm currently using. So far, I've only made some for Bash, Vim, and Tmux

*Vim (.vimrc):*
  Most of this I pulled from an old employer who had a standard .vimrc, that I mainly copied. Though I did change the color scheme.
  
*Bash (.bashrc):* 
  I believe this is just the standard .bashrc file. I'm not doing anything too crazy on the command line.
  
*Tmux (.tmux.conf):*
  I found this online ( GitHub user: spicycode, here's the url I used https://gist.github.com/spicycode/1229612 ). I made some slight       modifications to it because it's a little dated.
